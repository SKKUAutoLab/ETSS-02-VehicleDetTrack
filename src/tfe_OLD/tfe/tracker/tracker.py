# ``Tracker`` base class for all variant of tracker.
# It define a unify template to guarantee the input and output of all tracker are the same.
# Usually, each ``Tracker`` class is associate with a ``Track`` class
#
# Subclassing guide:
# 1. The package (i.e, the .py filename) should be in the template:
#    {tracker}_{track_motion_model}_{feature_used_to_track}
